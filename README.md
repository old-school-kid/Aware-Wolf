## 	:pushpin: The problem
1. <b>COVID restriction on gatherings</b>
It is almost impossible to do Yoga correctly without an instructor, and COVID has caused a serious
impediment to group gatherings.

2. <b>Meditation requires intense focus</b>
Present ways of meditation completely fail to create the immersive experience which is the cornerstone for
successful Yoga practice.

3. <b>Reinstating Indian culture</b>
Yoga was considered a relic of the past, but with more and more people realizing the benefits of Yoga, it
has opened up a huge demand for deep and revitalizing Yoga sessions, especially for the younger
demographic.

## 	:heavy_check_mark: The solution

1. Making Yoga accessible to people from the comfort of their
homes.

2. Multiple guided exercises with VR for an immersive
meditation experience.

3. Improving mental health and focus, it has a huge scope for
organizations and individuals alike.

4. Promoting the traditional Indian practices of Yoga and
simultaneously modernizing it to be accessible to a
worldwide audience.
